From this product new  technology  concept Decoy data, such as decoy documents, honey pots and other bogus information can be generated on demand and used for detecting unauthorized access to information and to poison the thief’s ex-filtrated information. Serving decoys will confuse an attacker into believing they have ex-filtrated useful information, when they have not. This technology may be integrated with user behaviour profiling technology to secure a user’s data in the Cloud. Whenever abnormal and unauthorized access to a cloud service is noticed, decoy information may be returned by the Cloud and delivered in such a way that it appears completely normal and legitimate. The legitimate user, who is the owner of the information, would readily identify when decoy information is being returned by the Cloud, and hence could alter the Cloud’s responses through a variety of means, such as challenge questions, to inform the Cloud security system that it has incorrectly detected an unauthorized access. When the unauthorised users access the system in that time the dummy file will be created and fully it will be encrypted. The encrypted data present in the document and it should be downloaded in the encrypted format to the users. This Process should be alerted to admin. Then the admin must suspend this account. This helps in secure process of communicating.
